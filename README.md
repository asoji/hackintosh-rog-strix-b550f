# Hackintosh - ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming (Wi-Fi)
OpenCore EFI for ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming (Wi-Fi) + AMD Ryzen 5 5600x + RX 570 8GB in a dual different GPU system.

This will be updated throughout time as I use my hack more and figure things out and try to document em. **This is currently an incomplete README.**

All files will be found [here](EFI).


## Tiny backstory and friends stuff

This isn't my first time hackintoshing, probably the 3rd time as of making this repository, but things got haha quirky oh my go- *cough*.

This time, this config was originally adapted from an OC EFI config that my boyfriend [@bluebeargreen-2](https://github.com/bluebeargreen-2) gave me and wasn't working originally for my system, even tho we have nearly identical motherboards, so I tried modifying it and cleaning it up to get it to work on my system, thank you Love. ðŸ’–

I would not have gotten to this point without the help from my best friends either, mainly my friend group's Queen of Hackintosh herself, [@dynamyc010](https://github.com/dynamyc010), and the other nerd who helped a bit along the way, [@CephalonCosmic](https://github.com/CephalonCosmic), who helped me with a few kexts stuff, and recommendations from her own hack. Of course my lovely boyfriend above helped me out as well, pointing out some small things along the way or making kext recommendations to each other to try to get each other's hacks working.

### NVRAM

The CPU Name stuff was an absolute pain in the ass for me, but this seems to be reliable enough, so just change the `revcpuname` string.

**None**, just use this as reference, if you somehow have the same specs I do, this might work for you, but me and my boyfriend said that about their config and oh boi, it did not, but it was a good starting point.
